# Ranking_Trees
## Python code and Jupyter notebooks for *Ranking Trees Based on Global Centrality Measures*

- **Ranking\_Trees--Centrality\_Bounds\_1.0.ipynb**: The poset structures on the set of non-isomorphic unlabelled trees based on path-to-star and star-to-path algorithms are explored in this notebook. 
- **Ranking\_Trees--Checking\_Bounds\_1.0.ipynb**: Some of the results regarding closeness and betweenness centralities for small trees are validated numerically in this notebook. 
- **Ranking\_Trees--Comparing\_Total\_Orderings\_1.0.ipynb**: Contains the code for comparing total orderings obtained from the distinguishing polynomial using two different approaches (degree-based and evaluation-based).
- **Ranking\_Trees--Distinguishing\_Polynomials\_1.0.ipynb**: Contains the code for computing the total orderings obtained from the distinguishing polynomial using two different approaches (degree-based and evaluation-based) and for exploring the connections between these total orderings and other graph statistics discussed in the paper.
- **Ranking\_Trees--Small\_Examples\_1.0.ipynb**: Contains the explanatory data visualizations for small trees.
- **tree\_functions_1.py**: All the functions defined by the authors and used in the above notebooks are in this file.
